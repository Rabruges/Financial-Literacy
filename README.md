# Financial Literacy Score with Machine Learning

The Financial Literacy Score is a tool developed by the OECD and allows to measure the financial literacy level of a person. The maximum score is 21 (a combination of a maximum of 7 for knowledge, 9 for behaviour and 5 for attitudes). 

**OBJECTIVE**
This Score could provide information beyond traditional financial measures.These are some questions that we want to answer

- Can someone with lower income have higher financial score than someone with higher income?
- Is true that for a given score, some individuals have faced or are facing material hardships or difficulty making ends meet?
- Are demographic characteristics associated with financial literacy?

The Bancolombia Bank measured the Score of more than 1.300 vulnerable people, many of them donÂ´t have a credit history. This Score will allow a better understanding of the financial habits of this population and thus offer financial products.
